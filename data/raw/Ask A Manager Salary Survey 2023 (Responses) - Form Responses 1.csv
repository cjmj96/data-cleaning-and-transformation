However, they've so far kept giving these one-time reimbursement (although I think the last one might be the final one they give us).

The 'base' level is determined as being the average for the province of Ontario. Personnel posted to areas with a higher COL receive PLD scaled to that area to make up the difference. In my case I am assigned to a ship in an area where housing, food, and fuel are significantly more expensive than in Ontario, therefore I receive PLD. Also note that Canadian Force pay scales are based on rank & trade group, not a specific position. So long as I am at this rank and in my trade, I am paid at that pay rate, regardless of the nature of my duties.

I'm also what's known here as a ""casual"" employee, what someone in the UK might call a ""zero-hours contract"". In the US think its just a regular hourly job. So I get 25% more p/h than someone with a permanent part-time or full time contract, with the understanding that 
a. I don't get leave. If you don't work, you don't get paid. (Leave which would normally be government-mandated, but this arrangement is legal too, the extra 25% is to compensate for it)
