## **Summary**

### **Goal**

Produce high quality data for Airbnb listings from Boston, MA. This data could help a data analyst to understand the current short-term rental market, providing insights that will guide the expansion of a real state company or individual.


### **Process**


I stored the data locally, then created a PostgreSQL database with multiple tables representing different elements of the data. Finally, I applied several techniques and methods to ensure data quality.

### **Highlights**


## **Introduction**

This project aims to generate high-quality data using different techniques and methods. This data can assist a data analyst in understanding the current short-term rental market to guide the expansion of a real state company or individual.

I have selected PostgreSQL as my primary tool to take advantage of its features and showcase my expertise.

The project methodology is based on CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining), incorporating only the components that aligns with project's objective.
